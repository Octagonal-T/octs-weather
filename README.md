Welcome to Oct's weather, a parry of Oct's calendar, made in October of 2020. The information is all fetched from (OpenWeatherMap's API)[https://openweathermap.org/].

Formatting might be a bit wonky as I'm not a proffesional front-end developer, so I did my best with the help of w3schools and 12-year-old-Stackoverflow posts.
